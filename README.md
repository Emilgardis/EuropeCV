# EuropeCV
TeX code associated to the EuropeCV [CTAN repository](https://ctan.org/pkg/europecv).

# Content of the package

The package contains the ```TeX``` and the ```cls``` files needed to create your CV in ```LaTeX```. In the package, there are some examples that you can follow to build your CV.

I apologize if some translations are wrong, but Italian is my mother tongue. I'm trying to improve my English skills, but it is not an easy task. So, please, do not hesitate to correct the information reported in this README.md file. 

Therefore, you can independently change the content of the translation files by editing the text in the ```.def``` files. The suffix "it", "de", and so on, indicates the language (e.g., "it" means Italian, "de" German, etc.).

Conversely, the ```.cls``` file contains the heart of the code. You can use it to redefine the package by adding your functionality. In such case, please feel free to share your code with the community members that already use EuropeCV.
