# EuropeCV
TeX code associated to the EuropeCV CTAN repository, https://ctan.org/pkg/europecv

# Content of the package

The package contains the ```\TeX``` files needed to create your CV in ```LaTeX```. In the package there are some examples that you can follow to build yours.

I apologize if some translations are wrong, but Italian is my mother tongue. Therefore, you can independently change the content by editing the text in the ```.def``` files. The suffix "it", "de", and so on, indicates the language (for example, "it" means Italian, "de" German, etc.).

The ```.cls``` file contains the heart of the code. You can use it to redefine the package (for example, replace the office phone number tag with the fax number one, and son on).
