# EuropeCV
TeX code associated to the EuropeCV CTAN repository, https://ctan.org/pkg/europecv

# Content of the package

The package contains the \TeX files needed to create your CV in LaTeX. In the package there are some examples that you can follow to build yours.

I apologize if some translations are wrong, but Italian is my mother tongue. Therefore, you can independently change the content by editing the text in the .def files. The suffix "it", "de", and so on, indicates the language (for example, it means Italian, de German, etc.).

The cls file contains the heart of the code. You can use it to redefine the package (for example, replace the office phone number tag with the fax number one).
